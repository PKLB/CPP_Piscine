/*It must allocate N Zombie objects in a single allocation. Then, it has to initialize the
zombies, giving each one of them the name passed as parameter. The function returns a
pointer to the first zombie.
Implement your own tests to ensure your zombieHorde() function works as expected.
Try to call announce() for each one of the zombies.
Donâ€™t forget to delete all the zombies and check for memory leaks.*/
